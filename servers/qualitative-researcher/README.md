- **has_status**: Links entities to their current status (active, completed, pending, abandoned)
- **has_priority**: Links entities to their priority level (high, low)
- **precedes**: Indicates that one analysis activity comes before another in a sequence

## Available Tools

The Qualitative Researcher MCP Server provides these tools for interacting with research knowledge:

### startsession
Starts a new qualitative research session, generating a unique session ID and displaying current research projects, recent data collection, emergent themes, and previous sessions. Shows status information via has_status relations, priority levels via has_priority relations, and identifies research activities ready to be worked on next based on sequential process relationships.

### loadcontext
Loads detailed context for a specific entity (project, participant, interview, etc.), displaying relevant information based on entity type. Includes status information, priority levels, and sequential process relationships.

### endsession
Records the results of a research session through a structured, multi-stage process:
1. **summary**: Records session summary, duration, and project focus
2. **interviewData**: Documents new interview data processed during the session
3. **memos**: Records analytical memos created during the session
4. **codingActivity**: Tracks new and revised codes applied to data
5. **themes**: Documents emergent or developed themes from analysis
6. **statusUpdates**: Records changes to entity status values
7. **projectStatus**: Updates overall project status, priority assignments, and sequential relationships
8. **assembly**: Final assembly of all session data

### buildcontext
Creates new entities, relations, or observations in the knowledge graph:
- **entities**: Add new research entities (projects, participants, interviews, status, priority, etc.)
- **relations**: Create relationships between entities (including has_status, has_priority, precedes)
- **observations**: Add observations to existing entities

### deletecontext
Removes entities, relations, or observations from the knowledge graph:
- **entities**: Remove research entities
- **relations**: Remove relationships between entities (including status, priority, and sequential relations)
- **observations**: Remove specific observations from entities

### advancedcontext
Retrieves information from the knowledge graph:
- **graph**: Get the entire knowledge graph
- **search**: Search for nodes based on query criteria
- **nodes**: Get specific nodes by name
- **related**: Find related entities
- **status**: Find entities with a specific status value (active, completed, pending, abandoned)
- **priority**: Find entities with a specific priority value (high, low)
- **sequence**: Identify sequential relationships for analysis activities

## Example Prompts

### Starting a Session
```
Let's start a new qualitative research session for my Health Behavior Study project.
```

### Loading Research Context
```
Load the context for the Health Behavior Study project so I can see the current state of my analysis.
```

### Recording Session Results
```
I've just finished analyzing interview data for my Health Behavior Study. I identified two new themes related to social support, coded three new interviews, and wrote memos about emerging patterns in participant responses. I've marked the initial coding phase as complete and set the thematic analysis as high priority. The project is progressing well, and I'm beginning to reach theoretical saturation.
```

### Managing Research Knowledge
```
Create a new code called "Family Support" that's part of the "Social Support" code group in the Health Behavior Study project. Set its status to active and make it precede the "Social Network Analysis" activity.
```

```
Update the status of the "Participant Recruitment" process to "completed" and add an observation that we've reached our target sample size.
```
